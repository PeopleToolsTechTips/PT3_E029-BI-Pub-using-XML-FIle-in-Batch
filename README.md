Running a BI Publisher report in batch doesn’t mean it has to use PSQuery as a data source. As per MOS (Doc ID 962712.1), an XML File is the most efficient way to feed the report data.

Just because most delivered BI Publisher reports in PeopleSoft use PSQuery as a data source doesn’t mean that is the best choice or the method you must choose. A PSQuery data source is inefficient, slower, and opens the possibility of someone breaking the report by modifying the public PSQuery.
